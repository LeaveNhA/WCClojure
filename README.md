# wcclj

A Clojure library designed to generate Hadoop application to count words based on [original WordCount example written in Java](https://hadoop.apache.org/docs/stable/hadoop-mapreduce-client/hadoop-mapreduce-client-core/MapReduceTutorial.html#Example:_WordCount_v1.0).

## Compile

Compile it with `lein uberjar`. Application jar is at `./target/gd-0.1-standalone.jar`. The output file name might vary based on the version of the project. You can simply follow the output of the compilation process to aim the final UberJar file.

## Clean

Compile the project clean with `leain clean`.

## Usage

Use the output UberJar from the source on your Hadoop environment with ease.
